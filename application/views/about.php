                      <h2>Your support can be the difference between life and death.</h2>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">Across Bangladesh, every day there remains an urgent need for all types of blood groups. Especially donors with rare blood groups such as O Negative, B Negative and A Negative are in high demand. Your timely response is essential to the supply of healthy blood for the massive daily demand we face.</p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">Your donation can save the lives of many, make a difference or simply make you feel great about your contribution to humanity. Whatever your reason, whatever your motivation we welcome you to learn more about eligibility and benefits of donating blood with a trusted organization like us.</p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">Find out more about local blood drives and BDRCS campaigns near you. Donate blood, save lives.</p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify">There are two ways that banks can protect the cord blood in transit: One, commonly used for donated cord blood, is to ship in a very heavily insulated box. These containers have so much thermal protection that cord blood can be sent via FedEx. Priority shipping services like FedEx guarantee arrival time but not temperature conditions during transit.

The second approach, used by many family cord blood banks, is to ship in smaller boxes that have less thermal protection but are carried by Life Sciences medical couriers. These couriers guarantee that boxes are kept in a passenger compartment where the temperature is in a safe range.

Ask the bank you're considering about the temperature stability of shipping containers and whether a courier service is used. Sometimes when banks try to lure parents with "discount" prices at "brand name" laboratories, you'll find that they're cutting corners on kit insulation and shipping procedures.</p>
